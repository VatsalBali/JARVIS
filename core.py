JARVIS - Day 1: Talk to an LLM (via Groq's free API) with tool calling.

Why Groq and not a local model: local inference needs a real GPU. With
integrated graphics only, running even a "small" model on CPU is painfully
slow. Groq gives free, fast, hosted inference instead - and it's
OpenAI-compatible, so the code below looks almost identical to what you'd
write for OpenAI or any other compatible provider.

SETUP:
1. Get a free API key: https://console.groq.com  (no credit card needed)
2. Set it as an environment variable so it's never hardcoded in this file:
       export GROQ_API_KEY="your-key-here"      (Mac/Linux)
       setx GROQ_API_KEY "your-key-here"         (Windows, new terminal after)
3. Install deps:      pip install groq
4. Run this file:     python core.py
